#6.0 PROJECT MANAGEMENT

#####6.1 Overview

In this project, we did a lot of brainstorming to find a simple yet effective and useful topic which we finally got but a quite a pleasant amount of time was lost during that period so on the next project we would focus on giving less time to the topic but not so less that it would make the project worthless.

#####6.2 Opinion

Also, in our opinion the project was quite a great success because it is quite useful in one of the daily activities of a person. Everyone nowadays have quite a busy schedule and even if you can squeeze up a little bit of that precious time and it is
worth every penny which is the exact goal of our project and the simplicity and ease of its use makes it even more desirable. So, definitely we would recommend this product and also buy it as well.

#####6.3 Difficulties and Outcomes

The most difficult part of our documentation would have to be the system architecture because after discussing what we were going to do, we had to figure out how we were going to do it. 
For instance, saying something is easy but implementing it to action is a whole another thing. 
That is what happened to us when we were trying to find the components of our system and put it together to make sense and further, make it work as well. 
Even though we looked up some things over the Internet, but also finding the required information you need is quite hard like finding a needle in a haystack. 
So the most difficult part of the documentation was the system architecture.
We were very happy with the project but even though so we also feel like we have missed some things here and there along the way and if we can figure it out it can become a whole lot better than it is now.
