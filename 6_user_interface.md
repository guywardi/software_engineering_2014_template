<li> Hardware components for navigation for the hardware components we have used a limited number of WIFI APs but can be increased and decreased per the need and requirement. 
We are using IEEE 802.11 WIFI APs. 
Also we are using Ethernet switches and Linux servers for different position query handling. These components altogether work as a position sensor and query handler.</li>

<li> A server and database for storing dataWe are using Oracle database system to manage and keep our database up to date. 
The database is stored in our server, which can be easily accessed, by our admin and users. 
The server also contains a detailed map of the location for an almost accurate navigation.
The database is constantly updated due to incoming new data for better performance and the server is all upgraded time to time due to enormous amount of incoming data.</li>

<li> An application to combine all above components The major component of the system, or literally, the user interface of the system is the software application named parking assistant, which is used by the driver for parking purposes. It runs on all android smartphones and we are also expanding it to  run on ios as well and windows phone as well. 
Map on the server is graphically presented in the users device and it uses the database and the WIFI APs to pinpoint the exact location on the map. Furthermore, it calculates the total parking time and reminds 20 minutes prior to the finishing time and you can also pay your parking fee through the same app easily. 
The best part is that you can easy locate your parked car through it as well.</li>
