#1.0 INTRODUCTION

Fortunately we have been very lucky to use a technology and invents of Global Positioning 

System (GPS) and we have been applying this technology from day to day service to 

industrial as well was security services. But this ‘talk of the town’ is only limited to wide 

open geological areas, therefore to harness the positioning system, let alone the satellite 

will not be much of a help, but using our simple and everyday use budget tools i.e. wireless 

devices might help in our scenario of acquiring IPS and applying it to the day to day use.

In this document we are proposing and introducing a smart way of parking and locating 

the vehicles inside a school area so that the student or teacher do not have to walk for a 

long time to locate the parked car and park in desired location to the nearest office or class. 

In order to apply those in real world scenario, the system will be integrated with Wi-Fi 

signaling device, central database server which can learn and calculate the shortest desired 

location to park, a good network and a smartphone with an application. In this system Wi-
Fi access points will be locating the position of the vehicles, free parking lot and navigate 

through the application Fingerprinting system will be applied so that it is more flexible 

and time efficient to park in the future which will ultimately save ones’ time, money and 

reduce the CO2 emission.
